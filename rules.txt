Stage One:
Life and death 

Stage Two:
Introduction of food and natural resources

Stage Three:
Competiton which leads to natural selection
also familiy constructions  


Rules that handel life and death

rule 1:
if a cell has more than zero of food it lives another generation 

rule 2:
if a cell has less than 0 number of food it dies

rules for familiy

rule 3:
if one cell and another cell have the same n range of food they join
to form a familiy

rule 4:
A cell moves towards the cells with the same range of food

rule 5:
A cell reproduces if the cell is joined into a familiy and has n number of resources 

agression rules 

rule 6:
if a cell has more number food than the other cell  it will attack

rule 7:
if a cell has speed it will obatin food fast but will require twice as much food also will work 
on a roll based system to obatin food

attributes 

rule 8:
if a family has n number of food it will produce a cell with the speed attribute
which will be randomized.

Notes:

We may have to apply hamiltons rule which states Hamilton's rule asserts that a trait is favored 
by natural selection if the benefit to others, B, multiplied by relatedness, R, exceeds the cost 
to self, C. Specifically, Hamilton's rule states that the change in average trait value in a population 
is proportional to BRâˆ’C. 

This can be summed up as the inequality Br - c > 0 

but we will have to rewrite this so it can be appiled to the speed attribute

The New equation will be written as Bp - c = EV 


We could interpt B as benefit and p is seen as possibility. C is cost and EV is equal value. Sort of
like gambling. 

a possible solution is to give the speed cell a choice that will let it create a familiy with another
of it's kind but will lose one food and may lose it's life . This will ensure a gamble that complies 
with hamiltons rule.
